        <h2>1. PUBG Mobile</h2>
        <p>My first youtube video was of me having fun in the battlegrounds. Yes, Pubg mobile is the only reason I started my youtube channel(even though very few people watches me). When i played the game, I thought how fun it would be if people who enjoys this game can relate to my funny encounters in-game. So, I started doing challenges and then introduced my friends to my channel and they helped me create more entertaining content. It's been a while since I have uploaded anything on my channel as of right now the game is currently banned in my country. I hope it comes back soon.
        PS: You can subscribe to my channel for some funny gaming content. *wink wink* </p>

        <h2>2. COD Mobile</h2>
        <p>Even before pubg mobile got banned in my country, COD mobile had a great player base and I was one of them. But I rarely uploaded anything related to it as the type of content that I liked creating could be achieved by PUBG only. And to be honest, not a lot of people are fan of COD's BR mode. Now don't think that I am taking any sides it just doesn't feel like a BR mode in COD. And I have no doubt that COD can beat any present game when it comes to it's vast multiplayer mode, a variety of loadouts, scorestreaks, operator skills etc. I played a lot of MP and ranked matches and had a blast with my squad. Every single minute is action-packed in COD that's why I turned to this whenever I had few minutes to spare.
        This is not an alternative to PUBG, THIS IS CALL OF DUTY.

        <h2>3. Among Us</h2>
        <p>Among us came out of nowhere and before I could think about it, I was lying to my friends and framing them for the murders that I committed(in games). Among us is a very easy game very different than the above 2 that I mentioned. It can be played on low-end devices easily. Just this small game and a few friends in discord is enough for a great time. There's no easy way to describe the fun you can have in tis game with your friends. I made few videos on this too and have many more videos waiting to see the light of the day and uploaded. I hope the day comes soon and my channel gets a decent number of subscribers. </p>
